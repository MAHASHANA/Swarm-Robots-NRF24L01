# Swarm-Robots-NRF24L01
This project was developed to investigate the viability of creating inexpensive swarms for educational purposes. We settled on the NRF24L01 transceiver module after some study because it is affordable and operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum. Which is the ideal option for wireless communication without an internet connection. Because this has a range that is far greater than Bluetooth and WiFi. Additionally, this module features six pipes that, when turned on, function as transceivers. This enables us to communicate amongst several devices simultaneously and with little to no latency.

Transmitter (1st circuit). Many iterations were carried out, as well as the design of PCBs. But I couldn't find any pictures of them (Sorry guys).
